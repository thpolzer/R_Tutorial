# R_Tutorial
This tutorial gives a hands-on introduction into the fundamentals of R-Programming.

IMPORTANT: Before you start: Pls adjust your RStudio settings according to "rstudio/RStudio_settings_01.jpg". For didactic purposes we have disabled automatic saving of current workspace.

To make things easier the workspace has been set to "~/R_Tutorial". That way, you do not need to adjust any file paths when loading data.
This has been done in the ~/R_Tutorial/startup.RProfile file.
(Pls note: Whenever you start an R session out of the ~/R_Tutorial directory R automatically searchs for a .RProfile file within this directory and executes the included code at the beginning of your session).
