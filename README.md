# R_Tutorial
This tutorial gives a hands-on introduction into the fundamentals of R-Programming.

IMPORTANT: Before you start: Pls adjust your RStudio settings according to "rstudio/RStudio_settings_01.jpg". For didactic purposes we have disabled automatic saving of current workspace.

To make things easier the workspace has been set to "~/R_Tutorial". That way, you do not need to adjust any file paths when loading data.
This has been done in the ~/R_Tutorial/startup.RProfile file.
(Pls note: Whenever you start an R session out of the ~/R_Tutorial directory R automatically searchs for a .RProfile file within this directory and executes the included code at the beginning of your session).

In order to reproduce the entire content of this tutorial you need to make sure that a MySQL database is running on your system.
Also, to interact with the MySQL database mentioned above, the following R package needs be installed using the following command: install.packages("RMySQL")
